For install XNC from sources do following:

Attention! While installing xnc, it uses xncsetup prog, which need X running
on Your machine. So do following commands from xterm.

Install:

   ./configure
   make
   make install
   xncsetup

Run:
   
   xnc 
   
           Enjoy!

Faster run:

   xncloader  - Do it just ONCE after starting X server.

   xnc        - xnc will use preloaded resources and start faster

           More enjoy!  :)

For any new user, who want to run xnc too, first run xncsetup from his/her
xterm then make all neccesary settings and press 'Save' button. Only after
that new user can start xnc properly.

About xnc functions, hot keys etc.. read docs in 'Docs' directory (html format).

P.S: If You like XNC, please, send me a letter with names of country and city
where you using XNC. It's for my collection.
