    HOW to localize XNC package.
-----------------------------------
There is one template for all package in this directory.
This file named 'xnc.pot' and contains all messages that need to be 
translated. 

If you want to translate package into your language for example French.
You copy xnc.pot into fr.po file. First two letters is language abreviation.
Before translating text you need to fill header of the file with your
name, e-mail, language and charset.
After that you edit your fr.po file and translate each line marked as
'msgid'. Translated text you put into 'msgstr' string.
just put your translated text under it. For examples see 'fr.po' in this
directory.

When you finish your translation or make a part of it you need to try
to compile it into binary format. Do this with command:
msgfmt -c --statistics fr.po -o fr.gmo
  or with simple script
./compile fr.po

If you see any errors, please, correct it.

After you translate all message, send me translated file (*.po) and 
i include it into xnc package. 
My e-mail is <leo@xnc.dubna.su>

Thank you.

P.S: You can modify your fr.po file at any time and compile it again for checks
