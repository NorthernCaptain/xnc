Hello!
Let me introduce the IVES v1.x.
IVES- Independent Viewing and Editing System.
This is multi-window system, that let You view and edit
many files at the same time in ASCII and HEX formats.

IVES can run in manual or automatic mode.
In manual mode just run "ives" then use "es filename" for edit
and "vs filename" for view with IVES.

In automatic mode just run "xnc" and it will do all work for You.

For keys see  'ives' man page.

Thank You.

PS: This version can view images in GIF,PCX,BMP,
       XBM,XPM,TARGA,TIFF and JPEG formats.
