 Description

   XNLAUNCH - X Northern Launch is a launch pad for X Window.
   This program allows You to quick launch X applications by pressing
   on button with image and/or name of it.
   XNLaunch easy configurable for adding new application buttons
   to launch menu.
     
 Options
    Command line option only one '-d display' specified name of display
    for connection to X Server.
    
 Configuration
 
   XNLaunch read configuration file '.xnlaunch.ini' from your 'HOME/.xlaunch'
   directory.
   
   Format of this file is very simple:
   
      - leoprogs.keys.background - background color for launch pad.
      - leoprogs.syscolor0 - color used for shadows.
      - leoprogs.syscolor1 - color used for text.
      - leoporgs.syscolor2 - color used for pad title.
      - leoprogs.font - font for title and text names.
      - xnlaunch.pixmaps.searchpath - path where xnlaunch will search
        for pixmaps named in '.launch.menu'
        First of all xnlaunch searches files in current directory, then in
        '$HOME/.xlaunch' and then in 'searchpath'
      - xnlaunch.geometry - X and Y are coordinates of left-top corner
        of pad window. Width and Height are sizes of one launch button,
        not whole pad window!
      - xnlaunch.pad.size - size and direction of launch pad (in buttons, not
        in pixels). Direction is a side of pad expansion if buttons  too many for
        described size.
        For example:    xnlaunch.pad.size: 1x3  - It means that pad width
        is one button and height is 3 button long. But if You defined more that
        three buttons in '.launch.menu', You do not need to correct this size.
        It will be correct automaticaly, and new size will be 1xN  so the higher
        digit define direction, for this is Y-direction.
        You can use any pad.size You want, not only 1x3 or 14x1. 
        20x30 also allowed :)
        
 Format of menu file '.launch.menu':
 
      In this file we define name of button, pixmap for it and application
      which will be run when You press on launch button.
      Each menu line define one button.
      Allowed any combinations of name/pixmap button, except full absence
      of name AND pixmap.
      
      Line consists from three part divided by ':'
      
      "name of button" : pixmap name : application name and parameters
      
      Name must be in   ""  but pixmap and application name must be
      WITHOUT it.
      
      Name or pixmap may be absent, but not the app name.
      Some examples:
      
        "Xterm": xterm.xpm : xterm -sb -title 'XTerminal'
                    : netscape.gif: netscape
         "XKill" :  : xkill
         
      You do not need to type '&' because xnlaunch always run 
      tasks in background.
      
      As You can see xnlaunch may load different image formats. How many
      formats it can understand depends on Your configuration of 
      ImagEngine for X Northern Captain.
      Currently You can load GIF, JPEG, PCX, BMP, XPM, XBM, TARGA and TIFF
      formats. All format are autodetected while loading.
 

  After starting xnlaunch (typically from '.xinitrc') You can launch any program
  defined in launch menu simply by pressing on launch button. You can move
  launch pad by pressing rught (3) mouse button on pad title and then dragging it.
