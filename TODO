                        X Northern Captain Project   1995-2002

To DO:

Hot list:
 - Scroll with wheel not by page, but for some lines with user defined value.

 - Extended bookmark that allows to store more that 9 entries.

 - Hot keys for sorting columns and reverse

 - Hot key and small window for fast search
 
 - Make ability to call alternative editor/viewer.
 
 - Customization of display modes (Full/Brief). User can choose from any attribute 
   to display in the panel. Give user mechanism of making sets of modes and quick 
   switching between them. Make two predefined brief/full sets.

[Done 24-06-2002]

 - Mouse actions. Add to configuration tab 'Mouse' and give user to choose which 
   action will be define on each mouse button including wheel and Ctrl/Shift modifiers.

[Done 09-06-2002]

 - Context menu for selected file(s). User presses hot key or mouse button and we build
   context menu with available actions according to file type and VFS type.

[Done 25-06-2002]

 - Change internal mechanism of drawing panel and make it flexibile for next plugin
   creation.

[Done 01-06-2002]
 - Make meta gui plugin (skining) that will read all configuration and images from files
   and draw another xnc look. This plugin give us the way to create new skins without
   writing some C++ code.   

 - BUG(Fixed): Can't enter localized symbols in command-line (in rxvt window can).

[Done 20-05-2002]

 - Normal history in cmdline. Use our common module 'history' for save/restore
   history of commands. Add button in the left of the cmdline. Pressing on this
   button will pop-up menu with history commands, choosing will insert it in
   cmdline.
[Done 10-06-2002]

 - Add 'Skip', 'Skip All' to dialog about overwriting files.

 - Add 'Split file' and 'Combine file' commands.

 - Add 'branch view' mode to panle which will display all files with subdirs in 
   one plane list  and do all operations with them.

 - Add 'Pack files into archive' command for packing files.

 - Add 'Rename file' (Shift-F6) for renaming file only, not moving.

Common, global tasks
-----------------------------
                1. FTP file system. Make FTP though 'ftp.xnc' - ftp agent that will be run
                    from XNC and do all FTP work (connect, get, put, ls etc..) and send
                    results to XNC.  Make ftp.xnc multithreaded with POSIX threads for
                    allowing multiconnections at the same time. If all of ftp work will be 
                    done by ftp.xnc then XNC will be only waiting for end of operation,
                    so make ftp timeout after which XNC sends current FTP panel to
                    background (bookmark) and activate previous VFS. 
                    (Think about methods of realizasion)...
                    
                2. MFS (Mtools File System). Make another class of VFS for working
                    with mtools (MS-DOS tools: mdir, mcopy, mdel...) as with normal VFS.
                    (Not very hard, just need correct parsing of mtools output...)
                    (But how to show mtools VFS in XNC? small floppy in bookmark? hmm..)
                    
                3. TFS (Trash File System). Make file system that allowed delete files/directories
                    to 'Recycle Bin' and then recover its. All other VFSes must delete files though it.
                    This TFS create '.xnc.trash' folder in home directory and store files there.
                    Double click on 'Recycle Bin' brings listing of deleted files/dir to active panel.
                    (Problem: How to show this directory tree, if we have many objects from different
                      VFSes. And How to recover? To the same path, where file was deleted or to
                      any other place?).
                      
                4. Directory Tree. One panel switches to directory tree mode, display directory hierarchy
                    and allow user to navigate though the tree and see contents of directories on the 
                    other panel.
                    
                5. Online Help system. In any window, at any time, by pressing help key show pop window
                    with context help information.
                    
                6. Make support for skins: Special image and coordinates translation table and XNC have
                    another look!!!
                    
                7. Add checking for running command in command shell (rxvt window). Currently no check, so
                   after running command XNC panel can't raise up when command is complete, cuz don't know
                   when it'll be. Any ideas?
                   
                8. Add support for mime.types (parsing and using) for automatically detect MIME types.
                   Not very hard but where to find application table for MIME->executable translation?
                   
                9. Add support for internal file scan contents (like 'file' through existing Magic file).
                   Use the same magic files as 'file' and add option for switch on/off such type of scan
                   at directory reading and option for showing this info in status bar.
                   Problem is: parsing of Magic files - need to include part of code from 'file' to XNC
                   or write such code by myself (i'm too lazy now for that :).
                
               10. Add linking magic numbers support with mime.types for COOL detection/running executables.
                   Cuz, all of this will be optionally.
                    
Other
--------
               1. Make INTERNAL 'move' operation instead of using 'mv' command.
                   There is already one variant of it, but problem is 'symbolic links'.
                   When trying to move symlink we can move it as symlink or as another
                   copy of file, but if that file had already been moved then symlink points to
                   nothing!!!  :(

  [+Done 08MAR98. Move symlink "As is", not move file it points to.]



               2. Make switch in 'copy/move' windows named 'Copy symlinks as is' which means
                   that we are copying symlink as symlink not as another copy of the same file.
                   Currently 'copy/move' operations copy not symlinks but files that followed by symlinks.
                   
  [+Done 08MAR98.]
                   

               3. Add 'destination path' edit field when copy/move many selected files.
               
  [+Done 08MAR98.]
               

               4. Make RPM package for RH5.0. Many users ask for it because rpm very simple
                   to install but hard for creating package... :)   (I don't know how to do it)
                   
  [+Done-i386.rpm] Need src.rpm...
  
               
               5. A way to customize the directory listing would be nice,
                   i.e. a way to adjust the columns to be printed and the width
                   of them.

               6. Long filenames problem. Can't execute files with spaces, brackets...
                   Can't detect such files inside AFS (archieves) (Any ideas how to do it?).
                   
  [+Done by Heiko Schroeder.]
  

               7. Second part of Offix DnD (drop files to XNC). Currently XNC can only
                   send file to another application. Make receiving DnD messages,
                   and sending groups of files not only single.

               8. Make option (in xncsetup or compile time) for switching off rxvt terminal.
                   XNC with this option enabled don't show terminal window and executes
                   all commands using 'system' call (work as filemanager only, not as terminal).
                   
  [+Done. Added option '-/+to and -/+su']
  

               9. Rewrite 'image/tiff.c' routines for compiling with not only TIFF 3.3 library.
                   TIFF 3.3 very old and current TIFFlib has another interface.
                   
              10. A way to create archives. For example: We select some files and dirs on panel,
                    then press hotkey, enter archive name, choose arhivator (TAR, ZIP, RAR...)
                    and XNC create archive with selected files on the other panel.
                    
              11. More datailed documentation and man pages.
 
  [+Done for man pages - yo-man format]
              
              12. Add history to all input fields. Store this history in .xnc.history file and load 
                    at startup.
              
  [+Done. But also need to show history pulldown window near every input field]
  
                    
              13. Make CUT/COPY/PASTE operations in all input fields.
              
              14. Problem with IVES running on two different displays for the same user. XNC running on
                 other than ives diplay shows files through ives on wrong display.
                 
              15. Make option to switch off status bar and/or it contents (filename/size/atributes/date).
              
  [+Done for status bar contents, not for whole one].
  
              16. Remake configuration using automake instead of autoconf.
              
              17. Add checking for system-wide 'jpeg', 'png' and 'zlib' libs to 'configure' script
                  and if found then using it instead of internal ones.

              18. Add configurable display in full mode of file size/attrs/date
                  Also need some way for configuring panel sub-part width. I 
                  mean with of file name or date or size etc..



              19. Make alternative editor, viewer options - will start 
                  alternative editor/viewer by pressing Ctrl+F3/F4. 
                  Must be added to setup, and keybinding.
                  
              20. Make data2c.cxx compiled in distro, and generate configs with it. Or may be don't include 
                  it in general building mechanism, just do it with 'make configs'.
